Single-cell Analysis Pipeline for GEM Resistance and TGFβ Signaling in PDAC



This repository contains scripts for a single-cell RNA-seq analysis workflow applied to study gemcitabine (GEM) resistance and TGFβ signaling in PDAC.



The pipeline starts with environment setup (conda) and preprocessing of scRNA-seq data, followed by downstream analyses including:



QC and filtering



Clustering



Trajectory inference (pseudotime analysis)



Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)



Differential Expression Analysis (DEG)



Principal Feature Analysis (PFA)



For network analysis performed in the associated publication, please refer to my colleague’s GitHub repository.
